<h1><center>User Management App which shows my skill in Java, servlets, working with SQL and Hibernate, CRUD in MVC pattern.</center></h1>


<p>In the app, we have clear division between backend logic, adapters for html in servlets and view in actuall HTML/CSS sites<br> (with thoose i needed AI help, so i dont take credit for view inself, i'm trying to focus on java, but i'm eager to learn).</br></p>

<p>Backend mostly oscilating around User/Role, UserDao/RoleDao where is the most essential backend logic, whole CRUD, roles adding, changing roles, building DB and testdb, and tests for backend.</p>

<p>Controller side of the app is build with all types of required servlets for frontend, starting from simple helloWorldServlet (where should be the main site but the app is not about that) to authorization, login, register, edit servlets, every information which frontend needs is adapted through here for backend, and sended back in correct form.</p>

<p>At the frontend we have HTML/CSS side of the aplication, so everything what user can do with the application</p>
